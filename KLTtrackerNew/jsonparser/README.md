# jsoncons: a C++ library for json construction

jsoncons is a C++ library for the construction of [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](http://www.json.org). It supports parsing a JSON file or string into a `json` value, building a `json` value in C++ code, and serializing a `json` value to a file or string. It also provides an API for generating json read and write events in code, somewhat analogously to SAX processing in the XML world. Consult the wiki for the latest [documentation and tutorials](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/wiki) and [roadmap](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/wiki/Roadmap). 

jsoncons uses some features that are new to C++ 11, including [move semantics](http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_02.html) and the [AllocatorAwareContainer](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/AllocatorAwareContainer) concept. It has been tested with MS VC++ 2013, MS VC++ 2015, and recent versions of clang and gcc.

The [code repository](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons) and [releases](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/releases) are on github. It is distributed under the [Boost Software License](http://www.boost.org/users/license.html)

The library has a number of features, which are listed below:

- Uses the standard C++ input/output streams library
- Implements parsing and serializing JSON text in UTF-8 for narrow character strings and streams
- Supports UTF16 (UTF32) encodings with size 2 (size 4) wide characters
- Correctly handles surrogate pairs in \uXXXX escape sequences
- Supports event based JSON parsing and serializing with user defined input and output handlers
- Accepts and ignores single line comments that start with //, and multi line comments that start with /* and end with */
- Supports optional escaping of the solidus (/) character
- Supports Nan, Inf and -Inf replacement
- Supports reading a sequence of JSON texts from a stream
- Supports optional escaping of non-ascii UTF-8 octets
- Allows extensions to the types accepted by the json class accessors and modifiers
- Supports reading (writing) JSON values from (to) CSV files
- Passes all tests from [JSON_checker](http://www.json.org/JSON_checker/) except `fail1.json`, which is allowed in [RFC7159](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7159.txt)
- Handles JSON texts of arbitrarily large depth of nesting, a limit can be set if desired
- Supports [Stefan Goessner's JsonPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)

As the `jsoncons` library has evolved, names have sometimes changed. To ease transition, jsoncons deprecates the old names but continues to support many of them. See the [deprecated list](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/wiki/deprecated) for the status of old names. The deprecated names can be suppressed by defining macro JSONCONS_NO_DEPRECATED, which is recommended for new code.

## Benchmarks

[json_benchmarks](https://github.com/danielaparker/json_benchmarks) provides some measurements about how `jsoncons` compares to other `json` libraries.

## Using the jsoncons library

The jsoncons library is header-only: it consists solely of header files containing templates and inline functions, and requires no separately-compiled library binaries when linking. It has no dependence on other libraries. The accompanying test suite uses boost, but not the library itself.

To install the jsoncons library, download the zip file, unpack the release, under `src` find the directory `jsoncons`, and copy it to your `include` directory. If you wish to use extensions, copy the `jsoncons_ext` directory as well. 

For a quick guide, see the article [jsoncons: a C++ library for json construction](http://danielaparker.github.io/jsoncons).

## Building the test suite and examples with CMake

[CMake](https://cmake.org/) is a C++ Makefiles/Solution generator for cross-platform software development. 

Instructions for building the test suite with CMake may be found in

## Examples

The examples below illustrate the use of the [json](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/wiki/json) class and [json_query](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons/wiki/json_query) function.

### json construction

```c++
    #include "jsoncons/json.hpp"

    // For convenience
    using jsoncons::json;

    // Construct a book object
    json book1;

    book1["category"] = "Fiction";
    book1["title"] = "A Wild Sheep Chase: A Novel";
    book1["author"] = "Haruki Murakami";
    book1["date"] = "2002-04-09";
    book1["price"] = 9.01;
    book1["isbn"] = "037571894X";  

    // Construct another using the set function
    json book2;

    book2.set("category", "History");
    book2.set("title", "Charlie Wilson's War");
    book2.set("author", "George Crile");
    book2.set("date", "2007-11-06");
    book2.set("price", 10.50);
    book2.set("isbn", "0802143415");  

    // Use set again, but more efficiently
    json book3;

    // Reserve memory, to avoid reallocations
    book3.reserve(6);

    // Insert in name alphabetical order
    // Give set a hint where to insert the next member
    auto hint = book3.set(book3.members().begin(),"author", "Haruki Murakami");
    hint = book3.set(hint, "category", "Fiction");
    hint = book3.set(hint, "date", "2006-01-03");
    hint = book3.set(hint, "isbn", "1400079276");  
    hint = book3.set(hint, "price", 13.45);
    hint = book3.set(hint, "title", "Kafka on the Shore");

    // Construct a fourth from a string
    json book4 = json::parse(R"(
    {
        "category" : "Fiction",
        "title" : "Pulp",
        "author" : "Charles Bukowski",
        "date" : "2004-07-08",
        "price" : 22.48,
        "isbn" : "1852272007"  
    }
    )");

    // Construct a booklist array

    // The short way:
    // json booklist = {book3, book4, book1, book2};

    // The long way:
    json booklist = json::array();

    // For efficiency, reserve memory, to avoid reallocations
    booklist.reserve(4);

    // For efficency, tell jsoncons to move the contents 
    // of the four book objects into the array
    booklist.add(std::move(book1));    
    booklist.add(std::move(book2));    

    // Add the third book to the front
    auto pos = booklist.add(booklist.elements().begin(),std::move(book3));
    
    // and the last one immediately after
    booklist.add(pos+1,std::move(book4));    

    // See what's left of book1, 2, 3 and 4 (expect nulls)
    std::cout << book1 << "," << book2 << "," << book3 << "," << book4 << std::endl;
```

```c++
    //Loop through the booklist elements using a range-based for loop    
    for (auto book : booklist.elements())
    {
        std::cout << book["title"].as<std::string>()
                  << ","
                  << book["price"].as<double>() << std::endl;
    }

    // The second book
    json& book = booklist[1];

    //Loop through the book's name-value pairs using a range-based for loop    
    for (auto member : book.members())
    {
        std::cout << member.name()
                  << ","
                  << member.value() << std::endl;
    }

    auto it = book.find("author");
    if (it != book.members().end())
    {
        // member "author" found
    }

    if (book.count("author") > 0)
    {
        // book has a member "author"
    }

    book.get("author", "author unknown").as<std::string>();
    // Returns author if found, otherwise "author unknown"

    try
    {
        book["ratings"].as<std::string>();
    }
    catch (const std::out_of_range& e)
    {
        // member "ratings" not found
    }

    // Add ratings
    book["ratings"]["*****"] = 4;
    book["ratings"]["*"] = 2;

    // Delete one-star ratings
    book["ratings"].erase("*");

```
```c++  
    // Serialize the booklist to a file
    std::ofstream os("booklist.json");
    os << pretty_print(booklist);
```

The JSON output `booklist.json`
```json

### json query

```c++
    #include <fstream>
    #include "jsoncons/json.hpp"
    #include "jsoncons_ext/jsonpath/json_query.hpp"

    // For convenience
    using jsoncons::json;
    using jsoncons::jsonpath::json_query;

    // Deserialize the booklist
    std::ifstream is("booklist.json");
    json booklist;
    is >> booklist;

    // Use a JsonPath expression to find 
    //  
    // (1) The authors of books that cost less than $12
    json result = json_query(booklist, "$[*][?(@.price < 12)].author");
    std::cout << "(1) " << result << std::endl;

    // (2) The number of books
    result = json_query(booklist, "$.length");
    std::cout << "(2) " << result << std::endl;

    // (3) The third book
    result = json_query(booklist, "$[2]");
    std::cout << "(3) " << std::endl << pretty_print(result) << std::endl;

    // (4) The authors of books that were published in 2004
    result = json_query(booklist, "$[*][?(@.date =~ /2004.*?/)].author");
    std::cout << "(4) " << result << std::endl;

    // (5) The titles of all books that have ratings
    result = json_query(booklist, "$[*][?(@.ratings)].title");
    std::cout << "(5) " << result << std::endl;
```
Result:
```
    (1) ["Haruki Murakami","George Crile"]
    (2) [4]
